### University Project for AOOP @ IPVC

#### Problem: Helping visually impaired individuals navigate safely

#### Description: Utilize YOLO to detect obstacles and important objects to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment.

#### Implementation Steps:

- Data Collection: Gather images of common obstacles and important objects (e.g., doors, stairs, etc.).
- Model Training: Train a YOLO model to detect these obstacles and objects.
- Real-Time Detection: Use a portable camera system to provide real-time detection.
- Guidance System: Develop an audio or haptic feedback system to inform users about detected objects and obstacles.
